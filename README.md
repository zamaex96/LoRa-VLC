Implementation of Hybrid LoRa-VLC communication uisng Ra-02 LoRa module with SX1278 chip, 433MHz antenna, and  STM32 microcontroller.

The code provided is a complete implementation of a diversity gain engine for an embedded system using STM32 microcontrollers. It involves initializing and configuring several peripherals, such as ADC, UART, SPI, and LoRa modules, to implement a diversity gain engine algorithm with three different combining techniques: Equal Gain Combining (EGC), Maximum Likelihood Combining (MLC), and Selection Combining (SC).

Here is a breakdown of the main components and their functions:

Peripheral Initialization
System Clock Configuration (SystemClock_Config):
Configures the system clock for the microcontroller.

Peripheral Initialization:

ADC Initialization (MX_ADC1_Init): Configures the ADC1 to read three channels using DMA.
SPI Initialization (MX_SPI3_Init): Configures the SPI3 interface for communication with the LoRa module.
UART Initialization (MX_USART1_UART_Init): Configures USART1 for serial communication.
DMA Initialization (MX_DMA_Init): Configures the DMA for handling ADC data transfers.
GPIO Initialization (MX_GPIO_Init): Configures the general-purpose I/O pins.
Main Function

Initialization:

HAL_Init(): Initializes the HAL library.
SystemClock_Config(): Configures the system clock.
Peripheral initialization functions.
LoRa_Module_Setting(): Configures the LoRa module.

ADC Start:

HAL_ADC_Start_DMA(&hadc1, (uint32_t *) rawValues, 3): Starts the ADC in DMA mode to read values into rawValues.

Main Loop:

Continuously calls DiversityGainEngineInit() to execute the diversity gain engine logic.
Diversity Gain Engine
DiversityGainEngineInit():

Collects ADC readings and estimates threshold voltage.
Selects the combining technique based on the estimated threshold voltage.
Combining Techniques:

ThresholdVoltageEstimator(): Estimates the threshold voltage.
CombiningTEchniqueSelection(): Selects the appropriate combining technique (EGC, MLC, SC) and performs data transmission using the selected technique.
EGC_Engine(): Implements Equal Gain Combining.
MLC_Engine(): Implements Maximum Likelihood Combining.
SC_Engine(): Implements Selection Combining.
SC_EngineReception(): Handles reception for the SC technique.
LoRa Module Configuration
LoRa_Module_Setting():

Initializes the LoRa module with specified parameters.
Starts continuous receiving mode.
LoRa_Transceiver_Init():

Demonstrates sending and receiving data using the LoRa module.
Callback and Error Handling
HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback():

Sets a flag convCompleted when ADC conversion is complete.
Error_Handler():

Infinite loop to indicate an error state.
Debug and Assertion
USE_FULL_ASSERT:

Provides assertion handling for debugging purposes.
If you need further customization or optimization, each function can be adjusted based on specific requirements or hardware specifications.
